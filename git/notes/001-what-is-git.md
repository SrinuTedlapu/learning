# 🟢 Step 1: What is Git and Why Use It?

## ✅ What is Git?

Git is a **distributed version control system** used to track changes in source code during software development.

It allows multiple developers to work on the same project **without overwriting each other's work**, and maintains a complete history of every change made to the codebase.

## ✅ Why Use Git?

### 1. 🕒 Track Changes

Git helps you track every modification to your codebase, who made it, and when.

### 2. 📦 Restore Previous Versions

You can easily go back to earlier versions of your code if something breaks.

### 3. 🤝 Collaboration

Multiple people can work on the same project **at the same time** without conflict using branches and merging.

### 4. 💥 Experiment Safely

You can create **branches** to try new features without affecting the main project.

### 5. 🌍 Open Source and Community

Git is free and used by millions of developers. GitHub (and others like GitLab) allow for sharing and collaboration in the cloud.

## ✅ Git vs GitHub (Don't Confuse!)

| Term       | Description                                                                            |

## ✅ Real-Life Analogy

Imagine you're writing a book:

- Git tracks **every edit** to your chapters.
- You can go back to a previous version anytime.
- You and your co-author can work on different parts **at the same time**.
- Git helps you combine your changes safely.

---

## ✅ Common Use Cases

- Tracking your personal code projects
- Collaborating on team projects
- Contributing to open-source repositories
- Backing up your code in the cloud (e.g., GitHub)
